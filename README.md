## 🔐 Wallet Setup — How It Works

No seed phrase. No browser extension. No manual configuration.

On your first message, the agent will:

1. Ask for your email address
2. Send a one-time verification code to your inbox
3. Complete login — your wallet is created inside OKX's TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
4. Show you your wallet addresses (EVM address for all EVM chains + Solana address)

Your private key never leaves the TEE. You authenticate with email OTP — no passwords, no seed phrases to back up.

## 🔄 DEX Swap — What You Get

Every swap goes through a 4-step flow before any transaction is signed:

```
1. Quote  →  2. Security scan  →  3. Preview  →  4. Your confirmation  →  Execute
```

**Example swap preview:**
```
Swap Preview
────────────────────────────────
Sell:   100 USDC  (Base)
Buy:    ~0.0341 ETH
Rate:   1 ETH = 2,932.45 USDC

Price impact:   0.08%  ✅
Gas estimate:   ~$0.12
Slippage:       0.5%

Security scan:  ✅ No risks detected

Type "confirm" to execute, or ask to adjust.
```

The agent **never executes a swap without your explicit confirmation.**

---

## 🛡️ Security Scan — Before Every Trade

Before buying any token, the agent automatically runs a risk scan:

- **Safe** — proceeds to show you the swap preview
- **Warning** — shows risk details, asks if you want to continue
- **Block** — refuses to execute, explains the threat (no bypass offered)

You can disable the security scan if you choose to — the agent will warn you first and ask for confirmation. When disabled, every swap shows a ⚠️ reminder.

---

## 🌾 DeFi — Deposit & Earn

Deposit idle assets into yield protocols and withdraw at any time. Ask the agent "show me available yield options" to see current protocols and APYs based on your holdings.

The agent checks for token approvals before depositing and handles the approve step if needed.
